        "OVERVIEW\n",
        "Build a small, text-based “Adventure Toolkit” program that helps a player prepare for a quest and then runs a tiny choose-your-own-adventure scene. Your program must demonstrate:\n",
        "• Chapters 1–2: variables, expressions, integer division // and modulus %, keyboard input\n",
        "• Chapter 3: functions (parameters, returns, docstrings), simple testing via printouts\n",
        "• Chapter 5: boolean expressions, logical operators, if/elif/else (chained & nested), recursion (with a clear base case), and basic debugging prints\n",
        "\n",
        "CONSTRAINTS (important)\n",
        "• Do NOT use loops yet (no for/while). Where you need repetition, use recursion with a base case.\n",
        "• Do NOT use lists, dictionaries, or advanced features from later chapters.\n",
        "• Your code must run from a single file: adventure_toolkit.py (plus README.md).\n",
        "• All input/output is via the console (input(), print()).\n",
        "• Use only the Python standard library.\n",
        "\n",
        "LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n",
        "By the end you should be able to:\n",
        "1) Use integer division // and modulus % to convert raw numbers into human-friendly units (time, coins).\n",
        "2) Write small, pure functions with parameters and return values (not just print inside).\n",
        "3) Combine conditions using and/or/not; use chained comparisons; avoid common pitfalls.\n",
        "4) Structure branching logic with if/elif/else, including nested decisions where appropriate.\n",
        "5) Apply recursion safely (with a base case) to re-prompt users or limit attempts.\n",
        "6) Apply basic debugging (targeted print statements) to trace values.\n",
        "\n",
        "PROGRAM SPECIFICATION\n",
        "Your program will run in two phases:\n",
        "\n",
        "Phase A — “Prep Utilities”\n",
        "A1) Time converter:\n",
        "    - Prompt for a positive integer of seconds.\n",
        "    - Convert to H:MM:SS using // and % (hours may be ≥ 0).\n",
        "    - Implement a pure function: seconds_to_hms(total_seconds) -> (h, m, s).\n",
        "A2) Coin change (fantasy coins):\n",
        "    - Prompt for a non-negative integer of copper pieces (cp).\n",
        "    - Convert into gold (gp), silver (sp), copper (cp) using: 1 gp = 100 sp, 1 sp = 10 cp.\n",
        "    - Implement a pure function: copper_to_coins(cp) -> (gp, sp, cp).\n",
        "    - Use // and % only; no loops, no lists.\n",
        "A3) Eligibility check:\n",
        "    - Prompt for player age and citizenship (y/n).\n",
        "    - Compute a boolean is_eligible = (age >= 18) and (citizenship == 'y'), then print a message.\n",
        "    - Demonstrate a chained comparison somewhere in Phase A (e.g., 0 <= seconds <= 100000).\n",
        "\n",
        "Phase B — “Mini-Adventure”\n",
        "B1) Scene flow with functions:\n",
        "    - Implement at least three scene functions:\n",
        "        • intro_scene(name) -> None\n",
        "        • fork_scene(has_torch: bool) -> str    # returns \"left\" or \"right\" ending tag\n",
        "        • ending_scene(tag: str) -> None\n",
        "    - Use if/elif/else (including at least one nested conditional) to branch narrative text.\n",
        "B2) Input validation via recursion:\n",
        "    - Write ask_int(prompt) that returns a valid int using recursion to re-prompt on invalid input.\n",
        "    - Write ask_choice(prompt, options) that returns a valid choice (string), using recursion.\n",
        "    - Each must have a clear base case to avoid infinite recursion.\n",
        "B3) Limited attempts via recursion:\n",
        "    - Implement guess_guard_code(secret:int, attempts_left:int) -> bool:\n",
        "        • If attempts_left == 0: base case → return False.\n",
        "        • Otherwise prompt, compare, recurse with attempts_left-1.\n",
        "        • Use if/elif/else; print hints like “too high/too low.”\n",
        "B4) Debugging requirement:\n",
        "    - Add one targeted debug print in the adventure (e.g., current_state, attempts_left).\n",
        "    - Include a comment “# DEBUG: …” and remove or comment it out before submission, or leave it but clearly labeled as DEBUG.\n",
        "\n",
        "INPUT / OUTPUT EXAMPLES (abridged)\n",
        "Example 1 — Time & coins\n",
        "Enter total seconds: 367\n",
        "H:MM:SS = 0:06:07\n",
        "Enter copper pieces: 1349\n",
        "Coins →  gp:1  sp:34  cp:9\n",
        "\n",
        "Example 2 — Eligibility\n",
        "Enter age: 17\n",
        "Citizen (y/n): y\n",
        "Eligible? False\n",
        "\n",
        "Example 3 — Adventure (snippets)\n",
        "What is your name, adventurer? Aria\n",
        "Do you carry a torch? (y/n): y\n",
        "At the fork, left path looks windy, right path is silent. Choose (left/right): right\n",
        "Enter the 2-digit guard code (3 attempts): 50\n",
        "Too low.\n",
        "Enter the 2-digit guard code (2 attempts): 77\n",
        "Success! The gate opens…\n",
        "\n",
        "SOFTWARE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS\n",
        "• Functions (Chapter 3)\n",
        "  - At least 6 functions total (including the required ones).\n",
        "  - Each non-trivial function has a one-line docstring describing its purpose, parameters, return.\n",
        "  - Use parameters/returns instead of relying on globals.\n",
        "• Conditionals (Chapter 5)\n",
        "  - Demonstrate: boolean expressions; logical operators; chained comparisons; chained and nested ifs.\n",
        "• Recursion (Chapter 5)\n",
        "  - Use recursion to validate input and to implement limited attempts.\n",
        "  - Each recursive function must have a base case and must progress toward it.\n",
        "• Keyboard input and formatting\n",
        "  - Use input() to collect values; convert with int() where needed.\n",
        "  - Clearly label outputs; keep text readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "GROUP WORK & PROCESS\n",
        "• Team size: 2–3 students.\n",
        "• Collaboration: Use pair-programming rotations; record who did what in README.md under “Contributions.”\n",
        "• Version control: one shared repo or zip is fine for this assignment; include both authors’ names in the header comment.\n",
        "• Testing: include at least 5 test transcripts (copy/paste console runs) in README.md showing:\n",
        "  - Valid → valid path\n",
        "  - Invalid → re-prompt recursion\n",
        "  - Boundary values (e.g., 0 seconds; attempts_left = 1)\n",
        "  - One failure path in the adventure\n",
        "  - One success path in the adventure\n",
        "\n",
        "STYLE & DOCUMENTATION\n",
        "• File header comment with course, names, date, and a brief description.\n",
        "• Docstrings for functions; meaningful variable names; whitespace and indentation consistent (PEP 8ish).\n",
        "• Keep functions small and focused. Avoid “god functions.”\n",
        "\n",
